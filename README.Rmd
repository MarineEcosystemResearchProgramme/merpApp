##### Shiny app to visualise CEFAS temperature data 
merpApp is a very basic Shiny app demonstrating some of the functionalities contained
in packages merpData and merpWS. 

## Running the app
merpApp can be run locally on a computer running R
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
runGitHub("MarineEcosystemReseachProgramme/merpApp")
```

## Development
Currently the app makes use of the merpWS package to access CEFAS temperature data.
Its functionalities are limited to plotting the positions where the data was recorded
and display a crude time series of temperature change for cells of a given within a given area.
Further developments soon to come!
